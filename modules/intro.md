Welcome! This learning path is based on the video series by http://OSTraining.com, supported by http://Acquia.com. The course introduces Drupal to absolute beginners. This learning path will give you an idea about the advantages of using a content management system and guide you through Drupal 8's new features. Although the series might be most useful for beginners, those who already know Drupal can also benefit from having a comprehensive list of the exciting new functionality Drupal 8 offers.
