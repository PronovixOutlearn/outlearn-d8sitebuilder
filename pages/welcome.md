# Welcome!

Greetings! Welcome to The Drupal 8 Beginner Class!

This class was originally created by the team at http://OSTraining.com and made possible through the sponsorship of http://Acquia.com. 
We have adapted it for an Outlearn learning path to help you learn more about the changes and new features Drupal 8 is bringing.

Good luck!
