# Advanced content handling and evaluation of modules
  
Now that you have learned about some modules and how you can use and configure them, it's time to look around and find some new ones that you might find interesting.
Go to the page [https://www.drupal.org/project/project_module](https://www.drupal.org/project/project_module) and use the filter to only list modules that are compatible with Drupal 8.
If you search for a keyword don't forget to set sorting to Relevancy to find the most appropriate results.
